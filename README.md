# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The run_analysis.R file performs the following tasks:

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
    The output file is: tidy_dataset.txt.
